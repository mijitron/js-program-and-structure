					<h1>FizzBuzz Exercise:</h1>
					<br>
					<p>
					Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

					When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

					(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, youâ€™re now allowed to feel good about yourself.)
					</p>
					<h3>You can check my results in the console.</h3>
					<p>
					I've also created a form using this same program which takes the input and displays the expected result. Check out the form below.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					  <form name="form1" >
              <label>Enter number: 
                <input type="text" name="num"> 
              </label>
            </form>
						<br>
            <button onclick="submit()">Submit</button>
            <br><br>
						<div>Result: <span id="result" style="font-size: 2em;"></span></div>

				//step 1. console.log numbers 1 to 100
					
				//for loop, first semi-colon initializes the loop
				//second semi-colon checks whether the loop should continue
				//final part updates the loop after every iteration
					
//				for (var x = 0; x <= 100; x = x + 1)
//						 console.log(x);
					
				//step 2. for numbers divisible by 3, print "fizz" instead of the number and for numbers divisble by 5 print "buzz"
					
//				for (var x = 0; x <= 100; x += 1) {
//					if ((x % 3 != 0) && (x % 5 != 0)) { 
//						//if the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number
//						console.log(x);
//					} else {
//						//if the number is divisible by 3, than print "buzz"
//						if (x % 3 == 0) {

				//e.g. see how on 15, it prints "fizz"
